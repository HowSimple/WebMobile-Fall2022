        <li>I've always been horrible at this game. Now it looks like a cat is even better than me. </li>
        <li>Love how the cat gave it some thought before ending the game.</li>
        <li>At the end, the cat was like, screw your games human, where's my food?</li>
        <li>That cat would probably beat 75% of the US population. </li>
        <li>Haha that stare towards the end. I knew he was going to do something mischievous.  I've seen that stare many times.  :-)</li>
